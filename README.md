# Welcome!

This repo was created for a side projects which will be some sort of marketplace. I haven't decided what it will look like or be used for just yet, but it will be developed using React, Typescript, and Material UI to learn how to create a page with premade components. In this marketplace I will also try to create a simple backend using express and most likely postgres to handle things like products, simple login page, and saving items to cart to be retrieved at a later time.

Site isn't deployed yet, but will be deployed to netlify and link will be inserted here.
