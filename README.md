# Welcome!

This repo was created for a side project. The goal of this is to try and get as close to [spotify's web player](https://open.spotify.com/) as I can while learning Material UI for the UI. I will also be using React and Typescript for the rest of the stuff.

Site isn't deployed yet, but will be deployed to netlify and link will be inserted here.
